Fix Receiver for FrySky Fport on CLI:
======================================
set serialrx_halfduplex = ON
set serialrx_inverted = ON
set gps_rescue_allow_arming_without_fix = on
set gps_rescue_angle = 40
set failsafe_procedure = GPS_RESCUE(always check this from cli before fly)



1. Metric
2. Command line: get gps_rescue
3.gps_rescue_initial_alt = 50-100
4. Gps_rescue_min_dth = 100 
5. gps_rescue_descent_distance = 200
6. gps_rescue_ground_speed = 2000/sec
7. gps_rescue_angle = 32 to 45 (good for wind)


Guardtime for stage 2 activation after signal lost = 4

=============================================================

Modes: Gps rescue mode

dshot_idle_value = 550 (correspond to GUI) 5.5% for resposive = 

set idle_min_rpm = 12 (14 for 5 inch)

 ===============================================
Taranis Dashboard Config:
https://github.com/iNavFlight/LuaTelemetry/wiki/
INAV Configurator Telemetry Setup:
==================================
Setup SmartPort(S.Port), F.Port, D-series, or Crossfire telemetry to send to your transmitter: INAV telemetry docs
FrSky receivers (skip for TBS Crossfire):
If you have an current sensor and want to show fuel percent remaining:
set smartport_fuel_unit = PERCENT
Set battery_capacity to the mAh you want to draw from your battery
If instead you want to show the current sensor's mAh:
set smartport_fuel_unit = MAH
With INAV v2.0.0+, set frsky_pitch_roll = ON in CLI settings for accurate attitude display and pitch angle

##Download the latest LuaTelemetry.zip file (Note: NOT the source code)
Copy the contents of the ZIP file (SCRIPTS and WIDGETS folders) to the transmitter's SD card's root.

Add Telemetry Sensors to Transmitter:
======================================
With battery connected and after GPS fix discover telemetry sensors so all telemetry sensors are discovered
FrSky receivers (skip for TBS Crossfire):
Telemetry distance sensor name 0420 (or 0007 with D-series receivers) should be changed to Dist and set to the desired unit: m or ft
The sensors Dist, Alt, GAlt and Gspd can be changed to the desired unit: m or ft / kmh or mph
If you set frsky_pitch_roll = ON on INAV v2.0.0+ (which I suggest) you can optionally change the following for clarification:
Telemetry sensor 0430 (or 0008 with D-series receivers) can be changed to Ptch
Telemetry sensor 0440 (or 0020 with D-series receivers) can be changed to Roll
Don't change Tmp1 or Tmp2 from Celsius to Fahrenheit! They're not temps (used for flight modes and GPS info)
If you don't have a current sensor, you can optionally delete or rename the Fuel sensor so it doesn't show in Lua Telemetry

on Taranis:
===========
In model setup, page to DISPLAY
Set desired screen to Script
Select iNav
Taranis:
From the main screen on your transmitter, long-press Page (down d-pad on X-Lite)
If Lua Telemetry isn't on your first page, short-press Page to the Lua Telemetry screen

Precheck inav:
1. Need to calibrate Mag (Never use FC internal Mag always use external GPS compass) and ACC 6 way 
2. cover barometa with a small peace of foam to protect from heat wind and light.
3. set nav_mc_hover_thr = XXXX (on test flight which posting is the stable hover position. Find by using althold and poshold mode)
4. gyro_ipf =256Hz(higher low pass filter value is higher sensitivity if lot of vibration on small quad then reduce the value to adjast with vibration 256Hz)
5. gyro_sync = on
6. gyro_sync_denom = 8 (means 1KHz pid rate)
7. Must set a failsafe button on Modes.

For RTH value:
set looptime = 2000
set min_check = 1100
set max_check = 1900
set nav_extra_arming_safety = Off (disable GPS if u want to disable)
